"""A web3.py Contract class for the {{contract_name}} contract."""

# contracts have PascalCase names
# pylint: disable=invalid-name

# contracts control how many attributes and arguments we have in generated code
# pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
# pylint: disable=too-many-arguments

# we don't need else statement if the other conditionals all have return,
# but it's easier to generate
# pylint: disable=no-else-return

# This file is bound to get very long depending on contract sizes.
# pylint: disable=too-many-lines
